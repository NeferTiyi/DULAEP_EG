# @generated_exts [( aux, bbl, idx, ind, lof, lot, out, toc, $fdb_ext )]
#     This contains a list of extensions for files that are generated during a LaTeX run and that are read in by LaTeX in later runs, either directly or indirectly.

#     This list has two uses: (a) to set the kinds of file to be deleted in a cleanup operation (with the -c, -C, -CA, -g and -gg options), and (b) in the determination of whether a rerun of (pdf)LaTeX is needed after a run that gives an error.

#     (Normally, a change of a source file during a run should provoke a rerun. This includes a file generated by LaTeX, e.g., an aux file, that is read in on subsequent runs. But after a run that results in an error, a new run should occur until the user has made a change in the files. But the user may have corrected an error in a source .tex file during the run. So latexmk needs to distinguish user-generated and automatically generated files; it determines the automatically generated files as those with extensions in the list in @generated_exts.)

#     A convenient way to add an extra extension to the list, without losing the already defined ones is to use a push command in the line in an RC file. E.g.,


#                     push @generated_exts, "end";

#     adds the extension "end" to the list of predefined generated extensions. (This extension is used by the RevTeX package, for example.)
